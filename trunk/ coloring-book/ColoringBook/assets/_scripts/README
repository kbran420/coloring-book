All scripts must be run from the root of the project directory.

build.sh

  This script is meant to be executed only once, right after a git clone
  (of the master AND submodule repositories). Run this script from
  the root of the project directory.
  
  It will customize the repository so that the application can compile
  properly, using your own IDs for various components. If you do not set
  up these components (either by running this script or through manual
  configuration of the necessary files), the application will NOT
  run properly. It may not even compile.
  
  To setup the necessary config variables, open build.sh in a text editor
  and only modify the CONFIGURATION section. Do not modify $PROJECT_DIR,
  unless you are moving the build.sh file.

  When you are ready, run the build script:

    assets/_scripts/build.sh all

nuke.sh

  This script is meant to be executed in order to comply with the
  licenses of the project. Information can be found in the COPYRIGHT
  and README files located in the root of the project directory. In
  short, by running the nuke script, you will remove all copyrighted
  materials under which no license of use has been provided. Be careful.
  This may break functionality, so do this when you have replacement
  assets.
 
  To print a list of files to be nuked without actually nuking them,
  run:

    assets/_scripts/nuke.sh list

  To nuke the files, run:

    assets/_scripts/nuke.sh all
